# UserQueue_CSharp
`UserQueue_Array` is a generic queue implementation in C# that supports various data types.
This queue is implemented using a `Linked List` and provides basic queue operations such as `Enqueue`, `Dequeue`, `Peak`, and `Print`.

*Keep in mind that this is designed for educational purposes and to demonstrate queue operations in C#.*

## Features

- **Generic Queue**: Works with mixed data types.
- **Enqueue**: Adds an object to the rear (end) of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Removes the object at the front of the queue and returns it.
- **Peak**: Returns the object at the front of the queue without removing it.
- **Print**: Prints out all the objects in the queue.
- **Clear**: Removes all objects from the queue.
